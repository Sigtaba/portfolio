                <div class="panel-body">
                  I was born and raised in St.Louis, Missouri.  After highschool, I moved to Oxford, Ohio to attend college at Miami University for business, but after a semester I realized Miami was not a culture fit for me, and I needed to be somewhere more diverse.  I transferred to DePaul University and joined the economic honors program and graduated with a BSC in Honors Economics.  After college I moved back to St. Louis and worked at various ecommerce positions, ranging from family businesses to more well known companies.  After a couple years of living in St. Louis I moved out to Portland, Oregon to work as an eCommerce Coordinator at CRKT.  There, I coordinated launch and maintenance development for the company's website.  While working with their outside dev teams, I realized I was much more interested in creating websites rather than managing them.  After about a year of working there I applied to Epicodus where I am now studying CSS and Web Design.
